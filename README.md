# Here are some simple computing projects with Python.
# These projects are related to the first official course that I have taken to learn Python.
# Calculation of time, calculation of area and perimeter of several shapes chosen by the user, formatting to mobile number, etc. are some of the projects that I share for you in this folder.
# I will gradually put other simple projects here.
